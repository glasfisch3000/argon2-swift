A memory-safe, zero-dependency Swift 6 implementation of [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2), the winner of the [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net) and the algorithm specified in [RFC 9106](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html).

Includes a slimmed-down memory-safe Swift implementation of Blake2b, containing only the operations needed for Argon2.

## Why This Library Exists

Most existing Swift Argon2 packages are thin wrappers around the C reference implementation or libsodium. While these are battle-tested and fast, they bring C's memory-safety failure modes into your Swift application — buffer overruns, use-after-free, and uninitialized reads at the FFI boundary.

SwiftArgon2 is implemented in pure Swift, with one carefully-scoped exception (see [Secure Memory Wiping](#secure-memory-wiping) below). It exists for applications where the security properties of memory-safe code are worth a moderate performance cost — typically client-side key derivation on mobile devices, where the algorithm is meant to be slow anyway.

## Features

- **Pure Swift 6** with structured concurrency (`async/await`)
- **Zero dependencies** beyond Foundation
- **Memory safe** — no `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, no FFI except for secure memory wipe
- **RFC 9106 compliant** — interoperable with the C reference implementation, libsodium, Password4j, Spring Security's Argon2PasswordEncoder, and any other spec-compliant verifier
- **All three variants** — Argon2d, Argon2i, and Argon2id
- **Secure memory wiping** of sensitive intermediate state (passwords, keys, memory matrix)
- **PHC string format** — produces and consumes standard `$argon2id$v=19$m=...` strings without padding

## Installation

Add this to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/mimiclone/argon2-swift.git", from: "1.0.4")
```

Then add `SwiftArgon2` to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "SwiftArgon2", package: "argon2-swift")
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### Hashing a password

```swift
import SwiftArgon2

// Argon2Params are optional and you will get these defaults if you omit them
let argon2 = try Argon2(params: Argon2Params(
    parallelism: 4,     // Number of lanes
    tagLength: 32,      // Output length in bytes
    memorySize: 65536,  // Memory size in KiB (64 MiB)
    iterations: 3,      // Number of passes
    variant: .argon2id  // .argon2d, .argon2i, or .argon2id
))

let hash = try await argon2.compute(
    password: "MyPassword".data(using: .utf8)!,
    salt: cryptographicallySecureRandomSalt   // 16+ bytes recommended
    // Optional: secret (keyed hash), associatedData
)
```

### Producing a PHC-formatted string

```swift
let encoded = try await argon2.computeEncoded(
    password: passwordData,
    salt: saltData
)
// "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$<salt>$<hash>"
```

The encoded string is interoperable with any RFC 9106-compliant verifier.

## Performance

This library is roughly 2-3x slower than the optimized C reference implementation when built with release optimizations.
This is generally a non-issue for Argon2's typical use case (client-side password hashing and key derivation where slowness is the point).
For high-throughput server-side password verification, a C-based implementation will be more efficient.

This library is **primarily intended as a key derivation function on mobile devices**, not as a server-side password hashing verifier.

### Use in Xcode apps

Argon2 is intentionally compute-intensive.
In Debug builds, Swift disables optimizations entirely (-Onone), which can make hashing take 20-100x longer than in Release builds.
A hash that completes in 200ms in Release may take 10+ seconds in Debug.

For development, consider:

- Reducing Argon2 parameters (memory cost, iterations) during Debug runs and using production parameters only in Release builds.
- Testing authentication flows against Release builds.
- As a last resort, adding -O to "Other Swift Flags" for your Debug configuration to force optimization across your entire app.

## Secure Memory Wiping

SwiftArgon2 securely wipes sensitive memory after use (passwords, secret keys, the H0 digest, the full memory matrix, and intermediate scratch buffers).
By default, this uses `memset_s` (Apple platforms) or `explicit_bzero` (Linux) via Swift's FFI.
Plain Swift assignment cannot reliably zero memory because the compiler may optimize away writes to memory that's about to be deallocated.

This is the **only** non-pure-Swift code path in the library, and it is contained to a single function with a clearly documented purpose.

To build without FFI-based secure wipe (strictly pure-Swift mode), remove the `MIMICLONE_SECURE_WIPE` define from your build.
In this mode, the library falls back to plain Swift assignment of zeros, which the compiler may elide. 
**Memory wipes are not guaranteed in this mode.**
Choose this configuration only if you understand and accept the tradeoff.

You can verify the active mode at runtime via `Argon2Configuration.secureWipeMode`.

## Platform Support

Tested on little-endian systems (Apple Silicon, Intel, modern ARM). This covers all current Apple platforms and the vast majority of Linux deployments. Big-endian support is theoretically correct per the spec but not exercised in CI.

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| macOS 15+ | Tested |
| iOS 18+ | Tested |
| watchOS 11+ | Tested |
| tvOS 18+ | Tested |
| visionOS 2+ | Tested |
| Linux (Debian) | Tested |
| Linux (Other flavors) | Not Tested |
| Windows | Not Tested |

## Test Vectors

The test suite includes the canonical RFC 9106 test vectors plus additional vectors generated against the C reference implementation covering:

- All three variants (Argon2d, Argon2i, Argon2id)
- Empty and non-empty secret/associated-data combinations
- Single-lane and multi-lane configurations
- Single-pass and multi-pass configurations
- Multiple tag lengths
- Production-scale parameters

If you discover an interoperability issue with another Argon2 implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mimiclone/argon2-swift/issues) with the failing parameters.
